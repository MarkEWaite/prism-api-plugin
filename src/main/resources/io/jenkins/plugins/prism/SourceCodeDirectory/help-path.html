<div>
    This plugin copies source code files to Jenkins' build folder so that these files can be rendered in the user
    interface together with the plugin results. If these files are referenced with relative paths then they cannot
    be found by the plugin. In these cases you need to specify one or more relative paths within the workspace where
    the plugin can locate them. Alternatively, you can also specify absolute paths if the source code files are stored
    outside the workspace (in a directory on the agent). All absolute paths must be additionally approved by an
    administrator in Jenkins' global configuration page.
